> In this manner, therefore, pray: Our Father in heaven, Hallowed be Your name... On earth as [it is] in heaven. [Matthew 6:9-10 NKJV]

When Jesus taught us how to pray, the first three requests were for God. Have you ever considered that we should be praying for God? Not only should we be praying for him but that is where we should start our prayers. Beginning there helps us get our frame of mind right before we start praying for ourselves and others.

The very first request we are to make is that God's name would be considered holy on the earth just like it is in heaven. Something holy is to be treated with respect. It is only to be used and thought of in pure ways.

If God's name is to be treated here just like it is in heaven, then we need to know how heaven treats our holy God.  Isaiah was shown the following vision of heaven.

> In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and the train of His [robe] filled the temple. Above it stood seraphim; each one had six wings: with two he covered his face, with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. And one cried to another and said: "Holy, holy, holy [is] the LORD of hosts; The whole earth [is] full of His glory!" [Isaiah 6:1-3 NKJV]

John was shown a similar vision some 800 years later.

> [The] four living creatures, each having six wings, were full of eyes around and within. And they do not rest day or night, saying: "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, Who was and is and is to come!" Whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to Him who sits on the throne, who lives forever and ever, the twenty-four elders fall down before Him who sits on the throne and worship Him who lives forever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying: "You are worthy, O Lord, To receive glory and honor and power; For You created all things, And by Your will they exist and were created." [Revelation 4:8-11 NKJV]

Day and night they continually recognize his holiness, worshiping Him and giving Him glory, honor, and thanks. This had been happening for a least 800 years and undoubtedly continues to this day.

Isaiah and John were given experiences of God's enthroned glory and holiness that few others have seen. Those who dwell in heaven continually experience His glory and holiness. This makes it easier for them to rightly consider God's name to be holy. 

How can we get a glimpse of this incredible scene? Jesus is described in Revelation 1:16 as `His countenance was like the sun shining in its strength`.  Psalm 19:1 states that `The heavens declare the glory of God`. Romans 1:20 states `since the creation of the world His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead`. Therefore, we can look to the dazzling glory of the sun to help us begin to perceive what our holy God seated on His throne is like.

Since we are to pray for God's name to be considered holy on the earth, that begs the question, "What is his name?".  His name is Jehovah. Our English translations usually write as `LORD` in capital letters as in Isaiah 6:3 quoted above.
